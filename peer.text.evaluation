Project: 05 Space Shooter
Peer's repository: https://github.com/jermaldo/05-Space-Shooter



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I didn't know how to make a thruster possbile for a space ship, which was interesting to play around with.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I would like to make the projects more interactive and a little different each time you look at them. Like with how in this project, there were many asteroids coming in from different angles.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
I understood how to move around, but there were times where I would intentionally hit an asteroid and nothing happened or the game would exit out. If we could fix that, that would make the game better.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
I would have liked some game instructions to explain what I needed to do for this game.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
Nothing in the code was particularly confusing.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
It would have been nice to get game instructions there.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
I enjoyed moving around in the space ship and having to dodge the asteroids. This game was well built with many complex little parts to make the game collectviely better.
